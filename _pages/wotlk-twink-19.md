# The ultimate, in-depth guide to level 19 character (WOTLK)

This tutorial has been originally written by **Arraj** aka **Sheena** of the *Warsong Clan*, a 19 twink horde guild of TrueWoW ([original post](https://truewow.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=102&t=13126&sid=011eb1e5779c2009707429455a32e6e0)). Her real life was Aleksandra, she died of an heart attack at her desk ([source](https://truewow.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=115&t=15280)).

I adapted her tutorial to this wiki, because many people found it very useful and because I wanted to honor her memory. May you rest in peace, champion!

## Intro

Wont include glyphs cuz it's pretty much "obvious" what to do with them and what spells to improve since on 19 you can use only 1 major and minor glyph.  
Also I think it's your personal choice what will your do with your talent points. We all have our style of play and I respect anyone's ways. With only 10 talent points to spend I dont think there is much space for mistakes. Just read carefully each talent and choose those which are fitting your playing style.  

Some terms you might not be familiar with:  
agm = [Arena Grand Master](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=19024)  
BiS = Best In Slot, item that you will probably never replace  
lb = [Lifeblood](http://wotlk.openwow.com/spell=55500)  

## Why would you make a level 19 character

Simple: CHALLENGE!  
You start with nothing and you end up with little = chalange. True fun about 19s is making something out of nothing. Many people say that its 2 button smashing bracket and it's truly not. I have 3 bars filled with hotkeys and 3 bars filled some other stuff to avoid complication while buffing myself with scrolls and food/drinks. I really have no intension on prooving those guys wrong, if someone wants a proof PM me I'll write you down list of my hotkeys and how frequently they are used. I'm sure you will be impressed how developed can rogue's combat be at lv19\.  
To back up my story I'll just say that yesterday in Gurubashi Arena I defeated 2 lv80s (dk & warr) and lv74 (paladin) while defending my friend to get AGM trinket, and than they came back again and died again and again and again... I went oom and some lock came and killed me in the end. I used like 3-4 keys the most as shadow priest. Those who know me, know how active that priest is and what mess is his UI, still it was piece of cake to fight vs them. Combat as lv19 rog is alot more complicated than the one I ever had on that priest mostly cuz of handicaps you are faced with and improvisations you gotta make to get something more out of it. It's not same for every class tough.  
However, in this guide I will show you how to find solutions to some of handicaps of your class and with some of them you can turn your warrior into a class with lay on hands spell that casts aoe fire spells, firebolts, nets and has a combat pet. Sounds interesting ??? I know it does. It's the beauty of lv19 where those minor hidden things in game, that have no place in 80 content, here can play a big role in duel or bg outcome. ( this will be covered in last part of guide )  

## Race / Class combinations 

Every class has it's best fitting race, we all know that but we dont always stick to that rule. Myself included hehe  
Here is the list of best race/class combos which can mostly be applied to any bracket. Still in lv19 it kinda plays bigger role than in other brackets mostly because you will be using your racial more often than in any other bracket. Also important thing to take in consideration is base stats of each race. Pick the one that fits your class the most, unless you really don't like the "looks" of it.

Warrior:  
- horde choice:  
Tauren - that extra stun is simply OP especialy in this bracket where you have no mounts  
Orc - racial that increases damage; increased expertise with axes which is important (see gearing up section)  

- alliance choice:  
Human - racial pvp trinket  
Draenei - racial heal that, if combined with lifeblood, can turn every class into damn fkn paladin  

Paladin:  
- horde choice:  
Belfs win by default  

- alliance choice:  
Human - racial pvp trinket  
Draenei - "moar healz plox"  

Rogue:  
- horde choice:  
Undead - racial that can remove fear or sleep effects (yea... you can make someone sleep in 19s )  
Troll - combine their racial with slice&dice = lightning speed atks  

- alliance choice:  
Human - same shit as above mentioned, that racial pvp trinket allows you to equip 2 agm trinkets = 240 hp  
Night Elfs - it's just hillarious to see those alliance guys playing damn GNOME ROGUES. Nelfs have racial VANISH. learn to use it nabs loool ! But as I myself dont play best rog race on horde side I belong to nab party too. Still if I ever played alliance rogue it would be Nelf.  
  
Warlock:  
- horde choice:  
Blood Elf: mana regen racial + silence to nearby casters = sexy stuff  
Undead: if you cast shadow dmg than it's nice to be ressistant to that one ;) plus you can remove fear from you making you look like a true master of your magic. This race makes you ultimate lock - resistant to what you actually do = EPIC imo  

- alliance choice:  
Human - booooring ehh? that trinket thingy again  
Gnome - not best choice but it's only one you can afford if you dont like humans ;) can get you some extra mana which is nice too  

Mage:  
- horde choice:  
Blood Elf: if you pick anything else go kill yourself. You just NEED mana so bad and that's making undead or troll really not good options for mage in 19s. Mage is mana consuming bastard.  

- alliance choice:  
Gnome: some extra mana  
Draenei: guess what... draenei mage with agm + lb + racial heal is almost a priest with mage's spells. He can heal others with gift of naru and I was in like 15-20 occasions where mage actually saved someone's life with this racial.  

Priest:  
- horde choice:  
Blood Elf: it's racial is simply the best choice for any caster in 19s - end of story.  

- alliance choice:  
Human: 2 agm = 240 hp or more spellpower with x2 heriloom trinkets. This is possible due to racial pvp trinket  
Draenei: Still with all benefits of human race 100% of alliance priests are draenei. Why? Extra healing spell, that's low if you ask me ;)  
  
Hunter:  
- horde choice:  
Blood Elf: extra mana + silence  
Troll: more atk speed and more dmg with bows  

- alliance choice:  
Night Elf: mostly cuz you stay invisible and start your surprise attack when enemy doesn't expect it  
Dwarf: 10% increased armor for 8secs + bleed & posion removal (yea.. 19s CAN have poisons, stay tuned ![:lol:](./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif "Laughing") )  

Shaman:  
- horde choice:  
Tauren: that racial stun can get you alot advantage over your opponents. You can get enough time to run away and heal up, or just to make range and pew pew your target while he is slowed by totem.  
Troll: extra cast speed, regen benefits, da voodoo shuffle makes this class good choice too. (edit - thanks to Ragnorak for tips)  

- alliance choice:  
Draenei wins by default (spacegoat with wolf form... epic ![:P](./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz") )  
  
Druid:  
- horde choice:  
Tauren wins by default  

- alliance choice:  
Draenei... ohhh wait ![:P](./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz") luckily they can't add one more heal to druids... Night elfs win by default ![:twisted:](./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif "Twisted Evil")  

## Gear lists

I wont make usual gear lists like you've seen in random guides all over internet. I'll do it on "my own way".  
Here is the list of items that are mostly used by all classes, those stuff are considered MUST HAVE for 99% of 19lvs. For more information about where to get each item just click the link. Items are listed as general stuff for everyone, non-caster and caster items. Just browse trough list and see what fits you the most.

WANDS:  
[Banshee Rod](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=31270) of the Sun (+1 sta spi sp) of the Moon (+1 sta spi int). I might be wrong about those random ench stats but those 2 enchs are best. If you get any other farm the mob more so you get one of two mentioned. both factions

## Enchanting suggestions
  
Enchants for rogue/hunter/enhancement shaman:  

Chest - 100 hp or +4 stats  
Cloak - 3agi or 12 dodge rating.  
Bracers - 9sta or 9str (rogue)  
Gloves - 15agi  
Legs - 16 armor leatherworking enchant  
Boots - 7agi or minor speed enchant, if you prefer more hp than pick 7sta  
Weapon - Rogue can benefit from every single enchantment if he can use it right (15agi, fiery, crusader and unholy). Huners should stick to 25 agi on weapon.  
Bow - scope +2 dmg  

Enchants for warrior/paladin:  

Chest - 100hp or +4stats (whatever you like more dmg or hp)  
Cloak - 70armor  
Bracers - 9sta or 9str  
Gloves - 7str  
Legs - 16 armor leatherworking enchant  
Boots - 7sta  
Weapon - Crusader  
Shield - 7sta  
Ranged - scope +2 dmg  

note: paladins that are focused on healing can enchant their gear as casters. It's rare to see on our server, tough...  


Enchants for priest/mage/warlock/druid/elemental shaman:  

Chest: since Inferno Robe is item lv40 you can enchant it with +6 stats or +150hp  
Cloak: 70 armor  
Bracers: 15spell power  
Gloves: Here is tricky part. Best thing for priest and druid is 16sp. For lock I would advise "shadow spell power +20 ench". For mage "frost or fire spell dmg +20" depending on what spell mage is using the most.  
Legs: +16 armor leatherworking enchant  
Boots: 7sta  
Weapon: 30spell power  


## Professions

_First Aid_ - this is simply a must have profession and get it skilled up asap. Heavy Runecloth Bandage will heal up most of 19s from 1hp to full in no time.  

_Cooking_ - Less popular and really underrated profession. True lv19 will always have cooking leveled so he never runs out of food buffs. Take a look at some nice examples:  
[Smoked Sagefish](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=21072) great for casters.  
[Thistle Tea](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=7676) rogue must-have.  
[Goblin Deviled Clams](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=5527) most commonly used food buff.  
[Lean Wolf Steak](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=12209) very easy to make cuz it's often drop from SFK mobs and wolves all over the world  

It appear that links for Pilgrim's Bounty recipes are not working so I'll just put it like this:  
There few mats that can purchased from event vendors. They last for 7days (real time). If you stock up on those mats and send them to your bank char and use it ONLY when really needed you can have following buffs for almost 2months:  

6sta + 6 hit rating  
6sta + 6 spell power  
6sta + 12attack power  

_Engineering_: good choice for extra stuns and head piece. Also if you use guns, you can craft your bullets. Personaly, I'm not a fan of this profession since you can get dynamites for non-engs and there is also one great thing I'll mention later which is also for non-engs. However, healers can buy them so wanted time with bombs to finalize their heals that take some time to be casted. Still in mass populated bg you wont really have much use of this.  

_Herbalism_ - simply a must have due to providing awesome heal over time. The only healing resource that non-healing horde 19s have. Alliance can always rely on thier damn Naru goddess and her Gift ![:P](./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz")  

_Mining_ - one of my favorites. You can skill it up to rank 3 which means extra 70hp.  

_Skining_ - great addition for anyone who wants more crit. chance. At rank 3 it gives +9 crit rating.  

_Alchemy_ - healing potions, switfness potions, various buffs trough elixirs. Lots of dmg absorbing stuff that can be used vs paladins and warlocks mostly. I dont recomend to have it learned since you can get herbs while having herbalism. If you can get materials you already have the product. Most players will make you wanted items for free if you can provide mats. Unless your high level character is alchemist ofc.  
Here is the list of best things you can get from this profession:  
[Healing Potion](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=929) best potion that you can use  
[Lesser Mana Potion](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=3385) best mana potion  
[Swiftness Potion](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=2459) great addition for anyone to cap flags, escape death, chase shaman/druid or rogue that sprints  
[Shadow Protection Potion](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=6048) thing I like to call "anti warlock potion" hehe  
[Holy Protection Potion](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=6051) "anti paladin" potion  
[Elixir of Lion's Strenght](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=2454) cool, easy to make  
[Elixir of Lesser Agility](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=3390) great source of extra agi for rogs and hunts  
[Elixir of Giant Growth](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=6662) gives you 8 str and makes you bigger = win win  
[Elixir of Defense](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=3389) like you have extra item equpied on you. Nice amount of armor for such low lv  

_Inscription_ - nothing else but scrolls. Dont ever pick this one for your twink, EVER! I listed it here just to provide a list of some scrolls that you can either buy or loot in rdf or world drops. I have tons of scrolls and I've never bought a single on of it.  
Here is the list of what you can use at this level (gonna list only the highest rank you can use):

[Scroll of Spirit II](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=1712) use it only when you are out of any above mentioned. 5 spirit at this point of game makes very little or no difference at all.  

Other proffesions are basicly useless... seriously.  

 
## "Secret" and rarely seen stuff

Finaly, we come to most interesting part of this huge post. All above mentioned is pretty much known and covered in many other guides but I took my time to write it down so our server can maybe become some source of wotlk twinking info.  

Lets start with things that make lv19 twinking so interesting and fun.  
I'll list all things I've discovered myself or told by someone and explain how it can be used in battleground or duels to make the most of it.  

1\. Large Rope Net  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=835](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=835)  

This is simply the most OP stuff you will ever encounter to stop a runner. This can be used even on lv80 and without any doubts can be considered as OP. Doesn't require much explanation how to use it. I would just advise that you dont waste this stuff just like that since it's drop rate is UBER LOW and it doesn't stack. Make sure you have space in your bags before you venture onto farming this. It's BoP so you wont be able to farm it with your high lvl char. Link says it's dropped by Defias Traper. I can't confirm that but I can tell you that it drops from Murloc Netters in Westfall ([http://wotlk.openwow.com/npc=513](http://wotlk.openwow.com/npc=513)). Once I saw the name of mob, and when he casted net on me, I asked myself: "would this net drop from him if kill 50-60 of them". I was obviously right. It's one of the discoveries I'm most proud of since it came to me without using any searching tools on net.  

2\. Magic Dust  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=2091](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=2091)  

Another great "spell" you can add to your class. Works pretty much as Succubus's Charm. Make your target use it's pvp trinket on something that lasts shorter and than just make him sleep. You will have more than enough time to do whatever you want, heal up, run away, re stealth... whatever you want lol! This item is great for stoping healers to do their job while you kill other players.  

3\. Glowing Cat Figurine  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=5332](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=5332)  

Your personal "non class bound" combat pet!!! It's farmed in north of Darkshore where nagas are. It will take some time for Ghostsabe to appear but surprise effect once you spawn it is priceless. It's unique item so you can't have more than one in your bags.  
Check the comments section on wowhead link for more informations about it:  
[http://www.wowhead.com/item=5332/glowing-cat-figurine](http://www.wowhead.com/item=5332/glowing-cat-figurine)  

4\. Discombobulator Ray  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=4388](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=4388)  

I have never seen someone using this in 19s wsg and it's something that's easy to make. 40 melee and sp dmg reduce is just awesome plus 20% movement speed reduce to stop players runing away = simply must have stuff and none is using it. I'm really surprised by that.  
However... the FUN factor of this item is priceless!!! Alliance tend to use that transformation item into red hulking ogre and than act like "big bosses" yelling around and trying to indimidate us with their pressence.  
We just loled so hard once I used this on Djambru and Aeglos and turned their huge ogres into little ugly gnomes hahaha... priceless I tell ya ![:)](./images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif "Smile")  

5\. Explosive Rocket  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=1178](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=1178)  

Great replacement for some engineer stuff. It can be obtained by completing lv3 quest which can be done in less than 20mins. Than just mail it to you 19 char. Delete lv3 char - make anonther - repeat. It's originaly available to alliance only but since our server allows x-faction mail even horde can get hands on this.  
It's best purpose is to reveal stealthed rogue in tunnels. Its free, it's easy to get, requires no prof. level to be used... nice stuff to have in bags.  

6\. Magic Candle  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=1399](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=1399)  

If you are melee class, without any dot skill (rogue, paladin, even warrior whose rend requires close combat) you can find this as a perfect way to prevent rogue from re-stealthing. It has 1,5 second cast, deals little dmg but leaves dot which will prevent rogue to re-stealth for next 4 seconds. Not OP dmg but still OP tactical use. Farmed from Kobold Geomancers in Elwyn Forrest.  

7\. Rumsey Rum Black Label  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=21151](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=21151)  

Well this is not rare at all, but had to list it. You will need highlv char to get this from Old Hillsbrad instance. It's fairly easy to get and provides awesome boost for hp, 150hp.  
It's stacks with other Rumsey stuff ( Rumsey Rum, Rumsey Rum Light)  
  
8\. Halaani Whiskey  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=30615](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=30615)  

Hard to get since you need your faction to control Nagrand pvp objectives, and you need to get your character there and buy it. You cant have more than 3 in bags which makes it kinda less worthy when you see how much effort it takes to get it. It stacks with all Rumsey Rum drinks and if you ever manage to drink all of them at the same time you will be some big ass HP dude but drunk as hell haha!  
  
9\. Charged Crystal Focus  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=32578](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=32578)  

Remember me talking about warrior with Lay on Hands spell ? You tought I'm crazy, I'm sure about it haha! Well just take a look at this item again and you will see that it instantly regenerates full hp of every 19lv character you ever saw... (well, maybe not Pyro's lol).  
Geting this item requires alot of patience. First thing you need to do is to farm Depleted Crystal Focus ([http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=32576](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=32576) ) with your 70+ character. Check where it drops on provided link Than send it to your 19lv. After that you will need warlock and 2 guys to summon you to Ogri'la in Blade's Edge Mountains. In case you can't find anyone to provide summon or take you to "pink spot on second picture" on 2 seater mount, I have a solution that is kinda hardcore.  
You will have to travel to Ogri'la on foot. Now you probably think "but there is no way I can get there." Well actually it is. I've done it countless times and I'll show you how:  
Make your way from Shatrath to Zangarmarsh than follow routes on images:  
[![Image](http://s1.postimg.org/xwusx01yz/image.jpg)](http://postimg.org/image/xwusx01yz/)  
after that make your way trough cave to Blade's Edge and follow next route:  
[![Image](http://s13.postimg.org/65mrmpeir/image.jpg)](http://postimg.org/image/65mrmpeir/)  
Once you are there farm Apexis Shard ([http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=32569](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=32569)) from nearby crystal veins. It's really easy cuz mobs are not hostile. Combine 10 shards with 1 depleted crystal charge to get 1 Crystal Charge Focus.  
Lot of work but totaly worth it!  

10\. Fel Sharpening Stone  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=23528](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=23528)  

All "guides" I ever read mention only Heavy Sharpening Stone. I'm really surprised how people didn't realized that this can be used to. There is not much to explain here. Get mats and get someone to make it or just buy whole product. Send your heirloom weapons to 50+ char and apply Fel Sharpening Stone on it. Send weapons back and enjoy +12 dmg instead of +4 what all other guides are telling you.  
However +4 is nice for non loom weapons and mostly used by rogues. Warriors and paladins can make the most use of +12 stone.  
  
11\. Felsteel & Thorium Shield spikes  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=23530](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=23530) & [http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=12645](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=12645)  

Not much to explain, only much to wonder how people rarely use this ;) Buy enchantment and apply it to shield. It WORKS and it's legal even tough it's from TBC.  
  
12\. Greater & Lesser runes of warding  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=25521](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=25521) & [http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=23559](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=23559)  

It's like you have priest's pw: shield on you with 90second cooldown. Thing is simply AWESOME! Easy to get, easy to apply. Send runes and heirloom chest item to your 55+ or 60+ char. Apply the rune on item and send back to lv19 character. That was easy and will sure help you survive!  

13\. Feathered Arrow & Exploding Shot  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=3464](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=3464) & [http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=3465](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=3465)  

Simply the BEST projectile you can ever have at lv19\. It's quest reward from Gelkis Centaur Clan in Desolace. I'm geting it this way:  
I go to "who list" and look for players in desolace, than ask them to go for Gelkis clan to get arrows/bullets. Later they just cod it to me at whatever price they think it's fair and job done. You can also make DK and get out of zone and finish quest yourself. Than delete DK and do it again. It's time consuming but there is almost 6 projectile damage difference between this one and those common projectiles from vendor. Other higher levels that skipped Desolace while leveling can also come back and get you this. I currently have over 500 and I constantly look for more because as rogue I'm using loom bow and with this arrows my damage crits sometimes over 300\. Have in mind that it's just normal bow attack, not hunter's skill.  

14\. Venomhide Poison  
[http://cata.openwow.com/spell=14792](http://cata.openwow.com/spell=14792)  

Who said that lv19 rogue can't have posion, or any other class lol?? Get your char to Un'goro, find Venomhide Ravasaur, keep on attacking him until he coats your weapons with this poison and that's it. People tend to send their looms on highlv char and do this, but I found a way to poison even other weapons that are not heirlooms. Here is how:  
For first time you will need to make flightpaths all the way from Orgrimmar or Thunderbluff to Marshal's Refuge camp. Just ask someone to escort you on 2 seater mount. I bet you dont want to explore the zones like I did, so it's no point in walking.  
If you have friend that will take you there it's piece of cake, but what happens if you want poisons and you buddy is not online. Follow this route and you will stay alive until you reach your mob:  
[![Image](http://s2.postimg.org/jq5e1xb5h/ungorocrater.jpg)](http://postimg.org/image/jq5e1xb5h/)  
Dont be "afraid" of dying to those ravasaur. Be prepared to totaly destroy your gear since sometimes it can take several deaths for posions to coat you weapons. Sometimes its gonna take 2mins sometimes 2hours... make sure you praise the lady luck before venturing to Un'goro. It lasts NINE HOURS and it deals 15dmg per tick but it stacks up to 3 times making it 45dmg per tick. That's huge if you ask me, especially if there are more guys with poison in same team. I wouldn't like to be in the skin of a guy attacked by 2-3 players with venomhide poison on their weapons.  

15\. Iron Boot Flask  
[http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=43499](http://wotlk.openwow.com/item=43499)  

Transforms you into darkiron dwarf and also gives you a [buff](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=58505#see-also-other) that deals 100ish dmg. Has like 10% chance to be casted and looks like Chain Lightning spell. Has 1 hour cooldown and not disappearing after it's used. Can be bought from [Olut Alegut](http://wotlk.openwow.com/npc=30472) in Storm Peaks.  


## Personal conclusions

That concludes the final section of this guide and belive me, I'm tired.  

I've been writing this all day, with some breaks ofc, so it's easily possbile that I've missed some stuff. If I notice that I've missed somthing I'll sure add it in future. I enjoyed making this post and I truly belive that some of you realized how complex lv19 character can become if you just scratch a bit under the surface. 

Some people might not like the fact I shared all this stuff in public mostly because 90% of this was never used in Warsong Gulch. Only few of us knew about those stuff. Now it's presented to you all. I think its fair that now we all have informations about those stuff and its gonna be interesting to see how many people will actually go for it.  

No other guide contains this stuff. Some guides have mentioned that Magic Dust or Crystal Charge Focus, but they never mentioned this much stuff mostly because they are focused only on basic thing that lv19 can do: get some gear and play wsg !
