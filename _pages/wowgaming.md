WoWGaming is a project that aims to provide a pool of <strong>Free</strong> and<strong> Open Source</strong> World of Warcraft resources specific for each expansion

&nbsp;

This project is totally <strong>free</strong> thankfully to our partners and donators:
<ul>
 	<li>We are financially supported by the no-profit organization: Drassil.org</li>
 	<li>We're hosted by Github and Altervista that grants us great resources at zero costs.</li>
 	<li>We're using free social tools such as: Discord, Google+, Disqus etc.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

We are <strong>Open Source</strong> because:
<ul>
 	<li>We're using aowow and trinitycore/azerothcore database for our db search engine</li>
 	<li>We're using a modified and open source version of wordpress for our wiki</li>
 	<li>All projects are stored on github organization: <a href="https://github.com/wowgame/">https://github.com/wowgame/</a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>This project can't die:</strong> In few words anyone can easily grab the entire pool of our data continuing our mission in any time.
